# Hi, I'm Abbas 👋

I'm a graduate software developer working with React, Next.js, and Python. I recently finished my MSc in Advanced Software Engineering at King's College London, where I got a distinction for my dissertation on network resilience.

## 🛠️ What I Build

I build full-stack web applications. My recent project was [minsabeauty.com](https://minsabeauty.com) - a website for a London aesthetic clinic. I integrated Google Sheets as a CMS so the client can update their services without needing to touch any code.

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, HTML/CSS

**Frameworks & Tools:** React, Next.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Docker, Git

**Currently exploring:** System design and building more production apps

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I'm looking for opportunities to work on interesting web projects and keep growing as a developer. I have academic research experience, client work under my belt, and can handle full-stack development from frontend to deployment.
